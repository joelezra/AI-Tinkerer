PART A   OVERVIEW

1     Introduction

1.1   The digitalisation of identification and verification processes is an important
      enabler to increase the convenience and reach, as well as lower the costs of
       financial services. A key aspect of digitalisation entails the delivery of end-to-
     end financial solutions through online and mobile channels, supported by the
      adoption of financial technology.

1.2   The digitalisation process, if not effectively managed, can become a source of
        risk to a financial  institution and can undermine the integrity of financial
       transactions. The Bank expects the outcome of e-KYC technology adoption in
      the  financial  sector  to  include  uncompromised  accuracy  in  customer
        identification and  verification, along with an ongoing assessment  of the
      robustness of the technology application.

1.3   This policy document sets out the minimum requirements and standards that a
       financial institution, as defined in paragraph 5.2, must observe in implementing
     e-KYC for the identification and verification of individuals. The requirements
       outlined in this policy document are aimed at-
          (i)   enabling safe and secure application of e-KYC technology in the financial
            sector;
           (ii)   facilitating the Bank’s continued ability to carry out effective supervisory
            oversight over financial institutions; and
           (iii)  ensuring effective Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of
           Terrorism (AML/CFT) control measures.

2     Applicability

2.1   This policy document is applicable to all financial institutions as defined in
      paragraph 5.2.

2.2   This policy document shall not apply to agent banking channels governed under
      the policy document on Agent Banking dated 30 April 2015.

3     Legal provisions

   PART B    POLICY REQUIREMENTS

   7    e-KYC implementation

         Roles and responsibilities of the Board

S  7.1  A financial institution shall obtain Board approval on the overall risk appetite
         and internal framework governing the implementation of e-KYC. The framework
            shall address-
                (i)    high risk or material risk scenarios that require subsequent Board
                 approval;
                 (ii)    variations or exceptions to existing e-KYC related products or methods
                   that require subsequent Board approval; and
                  (iii)    other instances that require Board approval.

S  7.2   The Board shall set and ensure the effective implementation of appropriate
           policies  and  procedures  to  address  any  risks  associated  with  the
          implementation of e-KYC. These include operational, customer information,
        human capital, information technology (IT) and money laundering and terrorism
           financing (ML/TF) risks.

           Identification and verification through e-KYC

S  7.3  A financial institution shall ensure and be able to demonstrate on a continuing
          basis that appropriate measures for the identification and verification of a
          customer’s identity through e-KYC are secure and effective.

S  7.4  A financial institution shall adopt an appropriate combination of authentication
           factors when establishing measures to verify the identity of a customer through
         e-KYC. The strength and combination of the authentication factors shall be
         commensurate to the risks associated with inaccurate identification  for a
            particular product or service.

G  7.5    In respect of paragraph 7.4, a financial institution should have regard to the
          three basic authentication factors, namely, something the customer possesses
            (e.g. identity card, registered mobile number), something the customer knows
            (e.g. PIN, personal information) and something the customer is (e.g. biometric
           characteristics). An e-KYC solution that depends on more than one factor is
            typically more difficult to compromise than a single factor system.

G  7.6    In identifying and verifying a customer’s identity through e-KYC as required by
          the policy document on AML/CFT and TFS for FIs, a financial institution may
          undertake measures including but are not limited to the following-
                (i)     verifying the customer against a government issued ID by utilising
                 biometric technology;
                 (ii)    ensuring that the government issued ID used to support e-KYC customer
                    verification  is  authentic  by  utilising  appropriate  fraud  detection
               mechanisms; and/or

    Issued on: 30 June 2020
      Electronic Know-Your-Customer (e-KYC)                                        6 of 24

                  (iii)   ensuring the customer is a live subject and not an impersonator (e.g.
                through use  of photos, videos,  facial masks) by  utilising liveness
                  detection.

        Use of artificial intelligence, machine learning or other forms of predictive
         algorithms

G  7.7   e-KYC solutions may utilise artificial intelligence, machine learning or other
         forms of predictive algorithms to ensure accurate identification and verification.
          This may result in automation of the decision-making process for customer
            identification and verification, thus reducing the need for human intervention.

S  7.8   Where the decision to verify a customer’s identity through e-KYC is automated
           with the use of  artificial intelligence, machine learning or other forms of
           predictive algorithms, whether in whole or in part, a financial institution shall
         ensure that the e-KYC solution is capable of accurately distinguishing between
         genuine and non-genuine cases of customer identification and verification.

S  7.9   For the purposes of paragraph 7.8, in ensuring accuracy of the e-KYC solution,
         a financial institution shall take steps to minimise the overall False Acceptance
         Rates  (FAR),  defined as              𝑁𝑜. 𝑜𝑓 𝐹𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠         𝑥 100 .  In
                                                  (𝑁𝑜. 𝑜𝑓 𝐹𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠 + 𝑁𝑜. 𝑜𝑓 𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒 𝑁𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠)
         measuring and assessing the FAR, a financial institution shall observe the
          considerations and requirements listed in Appendix 12.

         Reliance on human representatives

G  7.10  Notwithstanding paragraphs 7.7 to 7.9, a financial institution may also perform
        e-KYC where identification and verification is conducted solely by a human
           representative. This includes cases where the decision to verify a customer is
         conducted by a financial institution representative, intermediary or insurance
          agent, with the assistance of electronic means such as video calls using mobile
          devices.

G  7.11  In contrast with e-KYC solutions under paragraphs 7.7 to 7.9 that utilise both
         machine and human 3 capabilities, e-KYC performed solely by a human
          representative through electronic means may involve a lower level of identity
         assurance due to human limitations and thus may not be suitable for  all
          circumstances.

S  7.12  Where the decision to verify a customer’s identity through e-KYC is conducted
           solely by a human representative, a financial institution shall give due regard to


      2 For avoidance of doubt, requirements for FAR within this policy document do not apply to e-KYC
      solutions where the decision to verify a customer’s identity is (i) automated without the use of artificial
       intelligence, machine learning or other similar forms of predictive algorithms; or (ii) conducted solely
     by a human representative, as described in paragraph 7.10.
      3 By virtue of audits that are conducted under Appendix 1.

           situations where there  is potential for higher  risk of misidentification and
           establish necessary safeguards to address this risk.

         Addressing ongoing vulnerabilities

S  7.13  A  financial  institution  shall  continuously  identify and  address  potential
            vulnerabilities4 in the e-KYC solution.

S  7.14  In respect of paragraph 7.13, actions to address potential vulnerabilities shall
          include conducting reviews on the e-KYC solution and, where applicable,
          submitting  periodical feedback  to technology  providers  with  the aim  of
          improving effectiveness  of the underlying technology used  for customer
            identification and verification.

          Additional safeguards to facilitate deployment

G  7.15  The availability of data is an important factor in the effectiveness of e-KYC
           solutions for identification and verification.

S  7.16  Where there are limited data points to determine accuracy of the e-KYC solution
            in the initial deployment stage, a financial institution shall establish additional
          safeguards,  particularly  for products  that pose higher  risks  arising from
          inaccurate identification.

S  7.17  To facilitate deployment of e-KYC solutions for products with higher risks arising
         from  inaccurate  identification,  a  financial  institution  shall  observe  the
          considerations and safeguards specified in Appendix 2. This  list may be
         updated as and when there are developments  in the e-KYC landscape,
           including availability of better performance data on the effectiveness of specific
        e-KYC methods.

   8     Reporting requirements

S  8.1    In monitoring the effectiveness and accuracy of e-KYC solutions  utilising
              artificial intelligence, machine learning or other forms of predictive algorithms,
         a financial institution shall maintain a record of the performance of the e-KYC
           solution segregated on a monthly basis in accordance with the reporting
          template specified in Appendix 3.

S  8.2   The records required to be maintained under this policy document shall be
        made readily available for review by the Bank.

S  8.3  A financial institution shall submit the record in relation to paragraph 8.1 in
         accordance  with  instructions  set  out  in Appendix 5  via  the  Integrated

APPENDICES

Appendix 1: False Acceptance Rate


1.    In measuring the accuracy and effectiveness of e-KYC solutions, the FAR may
    be considered a useful measurement as it captures the capability of the solution
      to identify non-genuine identification and verification cases. Generally, a lower
    FAR indicates that the e-KYC solution has correctly identified non-genuine or
     fraudulent identification and verification attempts on a regular basis.

2.  FAR shall be measured based on the number of complete9 identification and
      verification cases processed under e-KYC.

3.    In determining FAR, a  financial  institution shall conduct audits to classify
      identification and verification cases into genuine and non-genuine cases. Where
         it  is not feasible for a financial institution to audit every identification and
      verification case facilitated through e-KYC, a financial institution may adopt a
     sampling approach. In doing so, a financial institution shall ensure that the data
    used to determine FAR is random, unbiased and representative of the customer
     base.

4.    In respect of paragraph 3 of this Appendix, a financial institution shall conduct
     audits on current month e-KYC cases by the last day of the following month (e.g.
     January cases to be audited by the last day of February) for the first six months
      of e-KYC implementation. After the first six months of e-KYC implementation, a
      financial institution shall conduct the audits no less than once every quarter,
    where current quarter e-KYC cases shall be conducted by the last day of the first
    month of the following quarter (e.g. first quarter cases to be audited by the last
    day of April).

5.  A financial institution shall aim to ensure that the overall FAR for the e-KYC
     solution does not exceed 5%. However, the level of FAR should also take into
     consideration the number of identification and verification cases, and the risks
     associated with inaccurate identification for a particular product or service offered
     through e-KYC.

6.   Generally, for e-KYC solutions leveraging the use of artificial intelligence, FAR
     should  reduce  with  the  increase  in  identification and  verification cases
     processed.

7.   Where the overall FAR is measured to be more than 5% for any three months
      within a six-month period, a financial institution shall notify Jabatan Penyeliaan
     Konglomerat Kewangan, Jabatan Penyeliaan Perbankan, Jabatan Penyeliaan
     Insurans dan Takaful, Jabatan Pengawalan Perniagaan Perkhidmatan Wang or

9 A complete identification and verification case processed under e-KYC is defined as a case where the customer
 has completed only the e-KYC checks as described in paragraph 2 of Appendix 3. This does not include other
  steps in the e-KYC processs (e.g. credit transfer).

      notification shall be made within seven working days upon the completion of the
      latest audit and detection of the aforementioned FAR scenario.

8.    In respect of paragraph 7 of this Appendix, the notification to the Bank shall
     include the following-
          (i)    an assessment on the current performance of the e-KYC solution,
              including reasons for the observed level of FAR;
           (ii)    proposed action to reduce the FAR going forward; and
           (iii)   proposed mitigating actions or additional controls to safeguard the
             effectiveness of the e-KYC process.

9.    In respect of paragraph  8(iii) of this Appendix, the mitigating actions and/or
      additional controls may include but are not limited to the following-
          (i)    enhanced monitoring of customers identified and verified through e-
          KYC; and/or
           (ii)    conducting audits on e-KYC cases prior to opening an account.

             technology;
           (ii)    ensure that the government issued ID used to support e-KYC customer
               verification  is  authentic  by  utilising  appropriate  fraud  detection
           mechanisms;
           (iii)   ensure the customer is a live subject and not an impersonator (e.g. use
              of photos, videos, facial masks) by utilising liveness detection; and
         (iv)   undertake measures to demonstrate that the customer has an existing
           bank account with another licensed person and is able to access said
           bank account. This may be achieved through requiring the customer to
            perform a credit transfer or to verify an amount transferred to the said
           bank account.

3.    In respect of paragraph 2(iv) of this Appendix, a financial institution shall ensure
      that the customer details (i.e. name or identity document number) obtained in
